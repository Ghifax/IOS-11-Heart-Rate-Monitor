# IOS-11-Heart-Rate-Monitor
This is the heart rate monitor app I made in 2018 using IOS 11.

<h2>How it works</h2>
After going on the app and tapping the measure button, a user would put their finger on the iPhone camera and wait 15 seconds as it takes a video recording. At the end of the 15 seconds, the app will output the user's heart rate.

<h2>Usage</h2>
Downloading all the files and running 'Heart rate measurer.xcodeproj' will enable you to use the app though you would need the correct IOS version (IOS 11) as the code has not been updated to the latest IOS. The app runs on Swift and was created using Xcode and CocoaPods as a dependency manager.
